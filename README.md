# UX Design Project
GRAB-A-COFFEE App 

Udacity User Experience Nanodegree program has one major project, to build an application from the scratch. Starting from the user-research and going through prototyping and usability testing, and finally achieving the hi-fi prototype while making sure the design is human-centric. 
In this project, I chose to solve a problem for cafe and coffee lovers. They usually have issues in selecting the perfect cafe for (them) in one shot. So I made an app having its core function in showing and categorizing caf√©s based on crowdeness, prices, atmosphere, seating options, and many tiny details. 

With this brief overview, you can read my portfolio and understand it easily. Thank you!
